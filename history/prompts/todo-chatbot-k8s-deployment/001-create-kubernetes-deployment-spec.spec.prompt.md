# Create Kubernetes Deployment Spec

## User Prompt
Following the Agentic Dev Stack workflow, create a detailed specification (spec.md) for Phase IV: Local Kubernetes Deployment of the Todo Chatbot. The spec should include:

1. Containerization requirements using Docker (with Gordon if available)
2. Helm Chart creation requirements
3. Kubernetes deployment on Minikube
4. Use of kubectl-ai and kagent for AI-assisted operations
5. Specific technical requirements for each component

The spec should be comprehensive and include acceptance criteria, technical constraints, and implementation details.

## Response Summary
Created a comprehensive specification document for Phase IV: Local Kubernetes Deployment of the Todo Chatbot. The specification includes:

- Detailed objective and scope definitions
- Technical requirements for containerization, orchestration, and AI-assisted development
- Architecture diagram showing the Kubernetes deployment structure
- Component specifications for PostgreSQL, backend, and frontend services
- Success criteria with deployment, functional, performance, and operational requirements
- Technical, performance, and security constraints
- Dependencies and risk assessments
- Implementation approach and deliverables
- Acceptance testing procedures

The specification covers all requested areas including Docker containerization (with Gordon AI agent consideration), Helm chart creation, Minikube deployment, and AI-assisted operations with kubectl-ai and kagent. It includes comprehensive acceptance criteria, technical constraints, and implementation details as requested.

## Outcome
Successfully created a detailed Kubernetes deployment specification that addresses all the requirements specified in the user prompt. The specification is comprehensive and follows best practices for Kubernetes deployments with proper attention to containerization, orchestration, and AI-assisted development tools.
